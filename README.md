ESP32-based NFC proximity card reader
=====================================

This is based on Espressif's [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) template app.

You will need to download [NXP's NFC card reader library](https://www.nxp.com/products/identification-and-security/nfc/nfc-reader-ics/nfc-reader-library-software-support-for-nfc-frontend-solutions:NFC-READER-LIBRARY) and unpack it in `compnents/nfc/<directory in zip file>` to build.

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.
